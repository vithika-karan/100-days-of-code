## **Problem Statement - 2**

You work for a small business that sells custom t-shirts online. The business has received a new order for a customer who wants to purchase t-shirts for their family reunion. They want to order a total of 20 t-shirts in different sizes and colors.

Your task is to create a Python program that calculates the total cost of the order based on the t-shirt sizes and colors chosen by the customer. 

Here are the details:
* The cost of a small t-shirt is $10, a medium t-shirt is $12, and a large t-shirt is $15.

* There are three available colors: red, green, and blue. The cost of a t-shirt is increased by $2 if the customer chooses a red t-shirt.

Your program should prompt the user to enter the number of small, medium, and large t-shirts they want to order, as well as the color they want for each t-shirt. Then, it should calculate and print the total cost of the order.
