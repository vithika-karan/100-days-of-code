## **Problem Statement - 3**


You are developing a program for a car rental company that offers discounts based on various criteria. Your task is to implement a Python program that determines the discount percentage applicable to a customer's rental based on the following conditions:

* If the customer is a senior citizen (age 60 or above), they are eligible for a 10% discount.

* If the customer is a student (age below 25) and it is their first time renting a car from the company, they are eligible for a 15% discount else 20%.

* If the customer is neither a senior citizen nor a student, they are eligible for a 5% discount if their rental duration is more than 7 days.

* If none of the above conditions are met, the customer is not eligible for any discount.

Your program should prompt the user to enter their age and whether it is their first time renting a car from the company. Then, based on their age, rental duration, and whether it's their first time renting, it should determine the applicable discount percentage and print an appropriate message.
